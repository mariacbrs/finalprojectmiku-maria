                        Many people know that anime is defined as cartoons originating from Japan. But did you know that anime is derived from the word “animation”? In Japan, we call all cartoons anime. It doesn't matter if it is from Japan or not, if it is a cartoon, it is called anime. But it is only in Japan. So in this page, I define anime as cartoons originating from Japan. There are a lot of kinds of anime these days. You can find funny ones, serious ones, touching ones and even cookery ones! Even if you are not a big fan of anime or cartoons, I'm sure you can find at least one that you like.

            <p>
                These days many people use streaming services to watch movies and tv shows. But before streaming services became a trend, broadcast TV was the major thing to watch TV. It is still popular and many people need it, however, streaming services have grown quickly in the past few years and some young people don't watch broadcast TV anymore. Of course both of them have pros and cons. So let's see it!

                <h3>Is streaming service killing broadcast TV?</h3>
                <p>
                    Broadcasting TV is still popular. However, these days there are many advertisements of streaming services on broadcast TV. I think it is funny that broadcast TV shows us those kinds of advertisements because if we go for a streaming service, some people never come back to broadcast TV. Streaming services are slowly killing broadcast TV as they grow, but I think broadcast TV themselves are killing themselves too.
